  <h1>Why Sculpin?</h1>

  <p>
    <strong>PHP static site generator.</strong> Fast and easy to get started. If your language of choice is PHP, you'll feel right at home if you need to extend Sculpin.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Composer-based installation.</strong> Forget about managing library versions manually! Sculpin installs easily using <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> to give you extra flexibility with whatever kind of site you're building.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Twig templates.</strong> <a href="https://twig.sensiolabs.org/">Twig</a> is a full-featured modern template engine. It's approachable to learn and it is extensible, documented, concise and flexible.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Symfony's HTTP Kernel.</strong> Sculpin is built on it. This lets you use Symfony Bundles to extend Sculpin for any advanced functionality you need without extending Sculpin directly.
